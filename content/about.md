# About

Frontend Walrus is a website where I share my studies and resources for front-end development. The goal is to share what I have learned with the aim of helping other developers.

You can find more information about me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renato-ac-lacerda), [GitHub](https://github.com/ralacerda), and [Portf√≥lio](https://portfolio.renatolacerda.com/).

The source code for this blog is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ralacerda/frontend-walrus).
